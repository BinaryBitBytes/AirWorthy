/**
 * Creates an Observable that emits events of a specific type coming from the
 * given event target.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Creates an Observable from DOM events, or Node.js
 * EventEmitter events or others.</span>
 *
 * ![](fromEvent.png)
 *
 * `fromEvent` accepts as a first argument event target, which is an object with methods
 * for registering event handler functions. As a second argument it takes string that indicates
 * type of event we want to listen for. `fromEvent` supports selected types of event targets,
 * which are described in detail below. If your event target does not match any of the ones listed,
 * you should use {@link fromEventPattern}, which can be used on arbitrary APIs.
 * When it comes to APIs supported by `fromEvent`, their methods for adding and removing event
 * handler functions have different names, but they all accept a string describing event type
 * and function itself, which will be called whenever said event happens.
 *
 * Every time resulting Observable is subscribed, event handler function will be registered
 * to event target on given event type. When that event fires, value
 * passed as a first argument to registered function will be emitted by output Observable.
 * When Observable is unsubscribed, function will be unregistered from event target.
 *
 * Note that if event target calls registered function with more than one argument, second
 * and following arguments will not appear in resulting stream. In order to get access to them,
 * you can pass to `fromEvent` optional project function, which will be called with all arguments
 * passed to event handler. Output Observable will then emit value returned by project function,
 * instead of the usual value.
 *
 * Remember that event targets listed below are checked via duck typing. It means that
 * no matter what kind of object you have and no matter what environment you work in,
 * you can safely use `fromEvent` on that object if it exposes described methods (provided
 * of course they behave as was described above). So for example if Node.js library exposes
 * event target which has the same method names as DOM EventTarget, `fromEvent` is still
 * a good choice.
 *
 * If the API you use is more callback then event handler oriented (subscribed
 * callback function fires only once and thus there is no need to manually
 * unregister it), you should use {@link bindCallback} or {@link bindNodeCallback}
 * instead.
 *
 * `fromEvent` supports following types of event targets:
 *
 * **DOM EventTarget**
 *
 * This is an object with `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods.
 *
 * In the browser, `addEventListener` accepts - apart from event type string and event
 * handler function arguments - optional third parameter, which is either an object or boolean,
 * both used for additional configuration how and when passed function will be called. When
 * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values
 * as third parameter as well.
 *
 * **Node.js EventEmitter**
 *
 * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.
 *
 * **JQuery-style event target**
 *
 * An object with `on` and `off` methods
 *
 * **DOM NodeList**
 *
 * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.
 *
 * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes
 * it contains and install event handler function in every of them. When returned Observable
 * is unsubscribed, function will be removed from all Nodes.
 *
 * **DOM HtmlCollection**
 *
 * Just as in case of NodeList it is a collection of DOM nodes. Here as well event handler function is
 * installed and removed in each of elements.
 *
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * Emit clicks happening on the DOM document
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * clicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * // Results in:
 * // MouseEvent object logged to console every time a click
 * // occurs on the document.
 * ```
 *
 * Use `addEventListener` with capture option
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const div = document.createElement('div');
 * div.style.cssText = 'width: 200px; height: 200px; background: #09c;';
 * document.body.appendChild(div);
 *
 * // note optional configuration parameter which will be passed to addEventListener
 * const clicksInDocument = fromEvent(document, 'click', { capture: true });
 * const clicksInDiv = fromEvent(div, 'click');
 *
 * clicksInDocument.subscribe(() => console.log('document'));
 * clicksInDiv.subscribe(() => console.log('div'));
 *
 * // By default events bubble UP in DOM tree, so normally
 * // when we would click on div in document
 * // "div" would be logged first and then "document".
 * // Since we specified optional `capture` option, document
 * // will catch event when it goes DOWN DOM tree, so console
 * // will log "document" and then "div".
 * ```
 *

 *
 * @param {FromEventTarget<T>} target The DOM EventTarget, Node.js
 * EventEmitter, JQuery-like event target, NodeList or HTMLCollection to attach the event handler to.

 * `target`.
